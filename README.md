by Oz Shy

*** R-code for drawing Figure 1 and Figure 2 and some numerical simulations: random_tariff_2025_mm_dd.R ***

Run the entire code first (don't forget to change the working directory).


*** Other files in the repository (not related to Table 1) ***

All algebraic derivations for the above article (not related to data) can be found on "random_tariff_2025_mm_dd.dfw.pdf" (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself.

The above PDF file was constructed using a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file "random_tariff_2025_mm_dd.dfw" requires this sofware (which most people don't have). Therefore, it is sufficient to download only the PDF.
